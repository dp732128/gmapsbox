There was 10 of us total who all stayed the night. We had an excellent evening. The pub is very warm and cosy with a lit fire and traditional d√©cor throughout. The staff were lovely and the food was very good. The menu also was very good as there was 3-4 items I could have easily tried on each course. & everything was cooked perfectly that I ate. The rooms were also very spacious and had good amenities. I would have liked to see a TV in there as well as a hairdryer but tbh I did not need one desperately. We had a very good nights sleep too. The only slight thing to critique was the wifi strength was not brilliant (there was no 4G) but it did work. It is often nice to disconnect for a few hours so this is a very minor thing. Lastly the breakfast included in the room rate was top notch. Great selection and again cooked breakfast was served to perfection. I would stay again in a heartbeat.

We had eaten here about 3 years ago one day for lunch , and we enjoyed, but the experience of staying over and having an evening meal was not good. Stayed in the Four Poster Room, which looks lovely and pink, and bright, and fresh on the photos, but in reality is not pink, or bright, very dull decor, tired looking, small, creaky, limited space , uneven wardrobe. The rooms are really close together , narrow stairway, noisy. Evening meal - Looked at the menu for our voucher - wasn't anything that sounded exciting so partner went for the so called named ""controversial"" lobster salad which was ¬£40. It had arrived and he was wondering where the lobster had gone, because the end bits of the claw was the only meat, very small scallops that were supposed to be king, so they kindly sent over an extra portion. The ambience in the restaurant, well, just wasn't any atmosphere at all. Very dim lit, with what felt like an old folks home.  No personality to it. Over priced drinks, which seems to be a common theme on these reviews, and totally agree with the chap who said they are obviously trading by their reputation, because for ¬£280 there are many many other places to visit, and get a much better quality stay.  Sat at breakfast - unprofessional staff, had to listen to the cleaner saying how mucky some people are as someone had left a bathroom dirty -",1678613193,False

We were very surprised by the excellent quality of the food and the attentive service provided by the very friendly waitress and barman.  Despite not being local to the village we were made to feel at home and were glad to spend our evening there.  Our only disappointment was the opening hours on the Saturday afternoon- you missed a few people calling in for a pint after we squeezed in for last orders!  We look forward to visiting the pub again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good solid local.  Thanks again for a lovely evening.,1663616552,False

The staff were also a little cold if I‚Äôm being honest. All the right things were being said; at best it was service without genuine warmth or ar worst pretty curt, depending on the member of staff.  A beautifully done out cafe.
