Food was always very good and staff were pleasant and cheerful. What a difference recently when we called on a Saturday lunch time to find the cafe completely empty. A girl came through to take our order, she didn't speak and seemed that it was a chore to serve. We both had fish and chips. Chips were fine but the fish was very poor quality as was the batter. I hope that this was a one off but judging by the empty cafe I don't think it was. We were the only people in the whole time we were there.
